END TERM PROJECT for VISUALIZATION IN GEPHI
A.C elegance Neural Network

One of the most difficult problems in neuroscience today is figuring out how to study and understand human brain structures and activities. The mammalian nervous system, on the other hand, is made up of billions of synapses and hundreds of millions of neurons. Because of this intricacy, it was hard to recreate such a large neural system in the lab. As a result, most researchers concentrate on the brain network of C. elegans. The neural network of C. elegans is the only fully mapped biological neural network. This neurological system is the most basic neural network known. Many basic actions, like as movement, come from this basic network.

(DATASET IN UPLOADED IN GOOGLE DRIVE)

Gephi software was used for the visualization and analysis of this dataset.

This is a part of the end term project submission for Fundamentals of Database Management System- Term-3 at FORE School of Management.
